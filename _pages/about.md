I received my PhD in May 2023 under the supervision of [Professor Krishnan Mahesh](https://name.engin.umich.edu/people/mahesh-krishnan/) at the University of Minnesota. The focus of my research is the insight that can be extracted from direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) of highly complex turbulent flows, including complex turbulent boundary layers and jets in crossflow. I am currently the Group Leader for Multiscale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at the [Research Center Pharmaceutical Engineering (RCPE)](https://www.rcpe.at/) in Graz, Austria, where I was previously a Senior Scientist working on the development of a boundary element method (BEM) for small-scale droplets.
