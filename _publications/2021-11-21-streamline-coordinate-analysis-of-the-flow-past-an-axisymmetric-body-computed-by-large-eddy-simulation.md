## Abstract 

Turbulent boundary layers with streamline curvature are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and the flow around axisymmetric bodies is further complicated by transverse curvature. We analyze results of wall-resolved large-eddy simulation of an axisymmetric hull in an orthogonal coordinate system defined by streamlines and streamline-normal lines. The numerical algorithm used in the present work is based on the unstructured overset method developed by Horne and Mahesh [J. Comput. Phys (2019) 397: 108790]. Equations in the streamline coordinate frame reduce to the Bernoulli equation and the Euler equation for curved streamlines away from the body and provide insight into the momentum balance within the boundary layer.
