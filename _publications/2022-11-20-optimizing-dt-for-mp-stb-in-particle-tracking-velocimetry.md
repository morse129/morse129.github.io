abstract: 'Multi-pulse tracking velocimetry is gaining increasing popularity in the fluid mechanics community. The basic working principle is to trace the particle displacements in multiple images separated by specified time intervals, and then the Lagrangian particle path and associated quantities can be determined. A recent breakthrough in particle tracking velocimetry was the introduction of the Shake-the-Box algorithm, which can accurately determine particle trajectories in a tomographic experimental setup. More specifically, multi-pulse Shake-the-Box has allowed for overcoming hardware limitations in which cameras cannot sample fast enough to time resolve the flow dynamics. However, the timing strategy of the multi-pulse technique must be specified by the user. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and assess the timing strategy used in multi-pulse Shake-the-Box for canonical flows, such as a synthetic jet, as well as to quantify the uncertainty associated with each strategy.<br /><br /> Funding for this work was provided by the Office of Naval Research under grant: N00014-21-1-2454.'
