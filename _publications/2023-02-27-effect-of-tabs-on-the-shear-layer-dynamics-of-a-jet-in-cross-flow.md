## Abstract 

Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a jet in cross-flow (JICF) with a triangular tab at two positions are performed at jet-to-cross-flow velocity ratios of $R = 2$ and $4$ with a jet Reynolds number of $2000$ based on the jet's bulk velocity and exit diameter. The DNS and dynamic mode decomposition show the sensitivity of the tab's effect on the jet upstream shear layer (USL) structure and cross-section to $R$, echoing the experimental discoveries of Harris et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 918, 2021). Furthermore, DNS reveals that the presence of a tab placed on the upstream side of the nozzle significantly modifies the USL through production of streamwise vortices that curl around the spanwise vortex tubes originating from the primary instability of the USL. This provides an explanation for the improvement in mixing that has been associated with an upstream tab. The streamwise vortex structure shows remarkable similarities to the ‘strain-oriented vortex tubes’ observed for disturbed plane shear layers by Lasheras & Choi (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 189, 1988, pp. 53–86). For both $R$ cases, the USL instability is delayed, the jet penetration is reduced, and the jet cross-section is flattened, although the tab has a less pronounced effect on the USL structure at higher velocity ratios, where the formation of the streamwise vortices is delayed. In contrast, a tab placed $45^\circ$ from the upstream position produces significantly different effects compared with the upstream tab. At $R = 4$, the jet cross-section is significantly skewed away from the tab and a tertiary vortex is formed, as observed in past studies of round JICFs at relatively high $R$ and low Reynolds numbers. The ability of the tab to produce a controllable steady-state tertiary vortex has implications for a variety of applications. The $45^\circ$ tab produces asymmetric effects in the wake of the jet at $R=2$, but the effect on the jet cross-section is much smaller, highlighting the sensitivity of jets at high $R$ to asymmetric perturbations.
